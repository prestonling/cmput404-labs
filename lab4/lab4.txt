2.)
shows a webpage saying that Django is installed
3.)
when going to /, says page not found (not defined in urls)
when going to /polls, displays "Hello world, you're	at the polls index."
4.)
Django migration is a way to update the database schema. We need it because we
want to make changes to the database, and we need to tell Django how to do that
5.)
We see a Django admin page, and we can add questions and choices to the
database. We go to the polls/admin.py file and add a model by using
admin.site.register({Model})
6.)
We see a page that displays "You're looking at question 38"
We see a page that displays "You're looking at the results of question 38"
We see a page that displays "You're voting on question 38"
We see a 404 "Page not found"
To allow arbitrary alphabetical characters, we change int to str in 
the url patterns. e.g '<int:question_id>/results/' to '<str:question_id>/results/'
7.)
If you make a change to the app structure, you would have to change all the hardcoded 
urls as well 
8.)
Generic views allow us to write less code.
We should use generic views when we have patterns in the templates
We shouldn't use the a generic view if we don't want to change the view.
